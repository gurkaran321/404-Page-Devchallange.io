# 404-Page-Devchallange.io
 This is the first challange from the responsive web developer path from devchallanges.io
## What I learnt while doing this challenge :

1. I was confused about what units to be used in margins and padding to make it more responsive, so after searching and trying I finally settled on vw and vh.
2. I learnt how to deploy website using github pages.
3. As i have not studied Flexbox and grid, so this was a good practise in creating layout using display inline-block.
